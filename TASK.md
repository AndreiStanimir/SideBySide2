## Development Notes

- Focus on modular architecture to allow components to be developed independently
- Prioritize PDF processing capabilities as they form the foundation of the application
- Consider performance implications of OCR processing and implement asynchronously
- Translation memory should use fuzzy matching algorithms for better suggestion quality
- UI should follow a consistent design language across all components
