I want to create a full stack app with electronjs, vue and c# .net(for backend) to aid translators to translate files, redact files, add adnotations and other stuff. 
Write a c# .net9 backend api to convert pdf to doc/docx, also does ocr the pdfs with tesseract
Write an electronjs app with on the left side a pdf viewer where you can edit the pdf, in the middle column a list of useful translation memory, and on the right side a preview of the translated document.
