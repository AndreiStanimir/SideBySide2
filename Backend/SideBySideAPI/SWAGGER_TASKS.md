This task list tracks the steps to fix the Swagger UI 404 issue.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Updated Program.cs to explicitly set RoutePrefix for Swagger
- [x] Added root redirect to Swagger UI
- [x] Added UseStaticFiles middleware
- [x] Created wwwroot directory
- [x] Created custom CSS and JS files for Swagger UI
- [x] Explicitly configured Swagger route template
- [x] Added ReDoc as an alternative API documentation UI
- [x] Installed Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.ReDoc package
- [x] Updated root redirect to point to ReDoc UI

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Run application with all fixes in place
- [ ] Test ReDoc UI in browser at /api-docs
- [ ] Test Swagger UI in browser at /swagger
- [ ] Verify API endpoints in documentation UI

## Implementation Plan

The issue was that the ASP.NET Core application couldn't find the wwwroot directory needed for serving static files, which Swagger UI requires. As an alternative approach, we've:

1. Added ReDoc as an alternative API documentation UI
2. Installed the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.ReDoc package
3. Configured ReDoc with a different endpoint (/api-docs)
4. Updated the root redirect to point to ReDoc UI
5. Kept the original Swagger UI configuration as a fallback
